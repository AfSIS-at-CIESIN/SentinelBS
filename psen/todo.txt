# Batch Data Processing via sentinel 1 toolboox
Features:
	1. Assign folder path
	2. Customized location
	3. Merge Every data files to a Mosaic
	4. Create Clip from Mosaic

The Calibration is from system default graph
The Mosaic is customized from ./graph folder
graph need revision to take input parameters

## TODO
1. Repo structure of dsen-ed file is changed. -- add a unversal preprocessing tools / config.sh so that all scripts can have a base on which to process the files
2. look into some java options during gpt, like the one you saw when refer "gpt mosaic width" on google


### 08.30
1. Mosaic incomplete:
	a. may be memory issue -- use -x flag to see if better
	b. parameter in xml file not specified -- check docs, no such thing -- may be the width -- YES that's the reason
	c. divide-conqure merge -- problematic
	d. right now seems like the comb of a & b makes this problem -- reason found

### 08.29
1. recursive merge folder based, rather than variable based, need to revise
2. if recursive works but all-at-once not, problems is the combination of two, later work involves tunning merge frag for memory utilization

### 08.25
1. new snap tool is deployed, code may need revision on calling which tool, and new single file processing graph updated

### 08.23
1. aware that the External DEM parameter in preprocessing graph has a external file location, which is a customized one. So whenever you try the script on new server, be sure to get that settled
2. combine the logic discussed to products:
	1. Revise to see if some parameters could be applied to Mosaic Graph

### 08.15
1. revise for real workflow

### 08.08
1. find if possible to do batch calibration -- seems not possible for desired result
2. try this -- for loop calibration; batch mosaic
3. Maybe the problem (null file) is from the fact that the test graph is not correct. Make sure that we have a correct graph before moving on to testing. -- The problem actually lies in the fact that revision is needed for taking input params
4. complete processor, test in real data

### 08.04
1. Graph preprocessing is possible -- see helper
2. Start from simple eg (one file, one operation):
	1. start from:
	 gpt.sh Read -Pfile='infile/S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20160111T175352_20160111T175417_009450_00DB31_C0C7.zip'
	This one works. But with designated graph, not working
3. The null file actually stands for input graph? -- Yes, input graph has no input node
4. Mosaic & others, if we could enter s1tbx w/o GUI, there is a way. There are included in the graph analysis tools.

### 08.02
1. Find related tutorial
	1. There is one sh called gpt.sh in S1TBX folder
	2. Read help doc "Graph Tools" section
